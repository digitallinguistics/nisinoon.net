</p>

This project is an NSF-funded cross-linguistic database of the components which make up words in Algonquian languages. There are two main goals:

1. To provide tribes with a source for lexical expansion for their language revitalization/reclamation projects.

2. To provide a basis for comprehensive reconstruction of Proto-Algonquian.

This database will be a web-based, open-access, centralized resource for Algonquian word components, providing community members and linguists with a set of data that has previously been difficult to access.

## What Does Nisinoon Mean?

[Nisinoon][Nisinoon] is an Ojibwe word meaning 'there are three'. We chose it to represent the tripartite structure of Algonquian words: initial-medial-final. Click on the word to learn more about the word and hear it pronounced.

## Algonquian Components Bibliography

The [Algonquian Components Bibliography][Bibliography] is a set of resources used in the [Nisinoon project][Home] to collect data on derivational morphemes in Algonquian languages. It was compiled by [Monica Macaulay][Monica] (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and [Hunter Lockwood][Hunter] (Myaamia Center, Miami University) with the help of Savana Stauss, Anushri Kartik-Narayan, and Rachel Fedorchak. Please let us know if you find any errors in the references.
