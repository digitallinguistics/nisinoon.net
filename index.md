</p>

This project is an NSF-funded cross-linguistic database of the components which make up words in Algonquian languages. There are two main goals:

1. To provide tribes with a source for lexical expansion for their language revitalization/reclamation projects.

2. To provide a basis for comprehensive reconstruction of Proto-Algonquian.

This database will be a web-based, open-access, centralized resource for Algonquian word components, providing community members and linguists with a set of data that has previously been difficult to access.

## What Does Nisinoon Mean?

[Nisinoon][Nisinoon] is an Ojibwe word meaning 'there are three'. We chose it to represent the tripartite structure of Algonquian words: initial-medial-final. Click on the word to learn more about the word and hear it pronounced.

## Algonquian Components Bibliography

The [Algonquian Components Bibliography][Bibliography] is a set of resources used in the [Nisinoon project][Home] to collect data on derivational morphemes in Algonquian languages. It was compiled by [Monica Macaulay][Monica] (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and [Hunter Lockwood][Hunter] (Myaamia Center, Miami University) with the help of Savana Stauss, Anushri Kartik-Narayan, and Rachel Fedorchak. Please let us know if you find any errors in the references.

If you see an error in this bibliography, or would like to suggest any additions, please email Monica Macaulay at [mmacaula@wisc.edu](mailto:mmacaula@wisc.edu).
